# Freely Controllable Visuals

People who are working on World models, eventually they want to have the power to fully control the visuals.

# The Future of Gaming: Infinite Customization Experience

The future of gaming should not be a closed experience but a limitless expansion. Traditionally, game content and mechanics are designed by developers, restricting players to predefined frameworks. However, the ideal game should allow players to freely expand and modify their experiences, turning at least part of the game into an evolving ecosystem rather than a static product.

Games like Terraria, Starbound, Minecraft, Risk of Rain, and Slay the Spire have already demonstrated the potential of modding, enabling players to add new items, enemies, and even alter game mechanics. However, their modding capabilities are still constrained by technical and design limitations. Modding currently requires specific tools, programming knowledge, or 2D/3D artistic skills, making it inaccessible to many players and preventing true on-the-fly customization.

Future games should feature built-in dynamic expansion systems, eliminating the need for players to learn complex development tools or programming languages. Instead, modding should be driven by natural language, allowing players to modify the game world in real time. Commands like "Generate a floating city in this terrain," "Give this NPC new behaviors and a unique backstory," or "Reverse gravity so water flows upward" should be instantly executable—without external plugins or technical barriers. LLMs and Agents can enable games to interpret player instructions and translate them into functional mods, making creation, modification, and expansion an intuitive process for everyone.

True game expansion should be unrestricted, adapting and evolving based on player needs. When modding becomes as simple as having a conversation, players will no longer be passive participants but co-creators of their worlds. This shift will redefine gaming—not as a singular experience, but as an ever-expanding, continuously evolving ecosystem where the only limit is imagination.
