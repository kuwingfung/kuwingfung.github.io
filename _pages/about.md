I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, Faculty of Mathematics, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of generative AI, visual content creation, and model interpretability. I’m particularly interested in making visual generation and editing (images, videos, and beyond) more controllable, interpretable, and usable in creative applications.

At the heart of my work is a simple but ambitious goal:

> Make visuals fully controllable, across whatever applications I care about.

My work covers:

- Generative AI
- Controllable Editing and Generation (Image, Video, and more)
- Multimodal Agentic Systems  (Visuals + X)
- Interpretability (e.g. Explanation)
- Creative AI Applications in Entertainment and Education
