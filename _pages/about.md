I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science student at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). I work closely with [Sun Sun](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2X_jP6kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Hongyu Guo](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/view/profile/members/4499) from National Research Council Canada.

I like to work on AI visual systems in terms of controlliability, robustness, and usability.

- Controllability: Give control to the user to generate and manipulate visual outputs.

* [DreamEdit](https://kuwingfung.github.io/publications/)

- Robustness: Design metrics and measure the performance of the visual model under various conditions.

* [GenAI-Arena](https://kuwingfung.github.io/publications/)
* [VideoScore](https://kuwingfung.github.io/publications/)
* [VIEScore](https://kuwingfung.github.io/publications/)
* [ImagenHub](https://kuwingfung.github.io/publications/)

- Usability: More efficient and effective visual communication.
