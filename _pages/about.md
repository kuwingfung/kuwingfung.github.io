I’m a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the **University of Waterloo**, Faculty of Mathematics, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). I work on visual content generation. Previously I have interned in [NVIDIA Deep Imagination Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/). 

At the heart of my work is a simple but ambitious goal:

> To make generative visuals fully controllable across science, communication, and creative applications.

While visuals remain my core focus, I'm increasingly curious about how they can integrate with physical reasoning and scientific understanding. I believe controllability in generative models should go beyond aesthetics, extending to physical coherence and alignment with how we perceive the world.

My work spans

- Controllable Editing and Generation (I prioritize editing over generation)
- Multimodal Agentic Systems (Visuals + X)
- Interpretability and Explainable AI
- Creative Applications in Entertainment, Education, and Science

Professional Activities

- Reviewed for: ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, SIGGRAPH Asia, SIGGRAPH, TVCG, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL

Community

- I lead [GGG](https://github.com/vinesmsuic/crisp-dl-read), a community-driven group dedicated to sharing and discussing papers on Generative AI.
- I host [Pro-bono Office Hour](https://forms.gle/x2cTvXhQw7Px2ojF8) to share advice with students from underrepresented backgrounds.

Misc

- [My Blog](https://vinesmsuic.github.io/), where I keep my reading notes and various logs.
- I was a member of the HK PolyU Robotics Team during ABU Robocon 2019-2021. [A playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXdlHsDGMmI&list=PLnBb01qou_lcYCLSfbAs-lZ5BZOzWsfSt)
- I used to compete in official gaming tournament [UGC League Team Fortress 2 Highlander](https://www.ugcleague.com/home_tf2h.cfm).
- "Wing Fung" (with the space) is my first name and "Ku" is my last name. "Max" is the commonly used "english name" that is not
  part of my legal name. [This is common in Hong Kong](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/hong-kong-culture/hong-kong-culture-naming#westernising-chinese-names).
