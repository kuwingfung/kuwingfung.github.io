I am now a Master of Math in Computer Science student at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). Previously, I earned [BSc in Internet and Multimedia Technologies](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/student-and-graduate-stories/) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University with first class honor, being advised by [Prof. Wan-Chi Siu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ouQRncoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Bonnie N.F. Law](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-law-ngai-fong-bonnie/).

My research interests encompass content synthesis and manipulation, including controllable image and video generation, multimodal large language models, and protein synthesis. I am an active learner, open to diverse topics and continually seeking new knowledge. Proficient in generative models, computer vision, and signal processing, I aspire to merge cutting-edge research with robust software practices to develop AI systems characterized by high controllability, reliability, and usability.
