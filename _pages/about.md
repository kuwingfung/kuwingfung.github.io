I am now a Master of Math in Computer Science student at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). Previously, I earned [BSc in Internet and Multimedia Technologies](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/student-and-graduate-stories/) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University with first class honor, being advised by [Prof. Bonnie N.F. Law](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-law-ngai-fong-bonnie/) and [Prof. Wan-Chi Siu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ouQRncoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am glad that I was involved in RoboCon and VR contests during my undergraduate study, in which I acquired technical skills and developed the mindset of a professional engineer. The academic environment also raised my interest in research. My research interests are Computer Vision and Multimodal Generative Models, and I enjoy exploring SOTA technologies in 2D image and 3D vision areas. My goal is to create tools to free human's creativity and visualize their mind, produce content with ease.
