I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of generative AI, visual content creation, and model interpretability. I’m particularly focused on advancing controllable generation and editing of visual media (image, video, and beyond), and on evaluating and improving the interpretability of generative models.

At the core of my research is a simple but ambitious goal:

> Make visuals fully controllable and extend this control beyond visuals.

My work covers:

- Generative AI
- Controllable Generation / Editing (Image, Video, and more)
- Multi Modalities (Visuals + X)
- Interpretability (by all means)
- Creative applications in Entertainment and Education
