I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the **University of Waterloo**, Faculty of Mathematics, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/) and [Yuntian Deng](https://yuntiandeng.com/). I work on visual content generation. Previously I have interned in [NVIDIA Deep Imagination Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/).

At the heart of my work is a simple but ambitious goal:

> To make generative visuals fully controllable across science, communication, and creative applications.

While visuals remain my core focus, I am increasingly curious about how they can integrate with physical reasoning and scientific understanding. I believe controllability in generative models should go beyond aesthetics, extending to physical coherence and alignment with how we perceive the world.

My research interest spans

- Controllable Editing and Generation (I prioritize editing over generation)
- World Models (Games, Agent, Physics, ...)
- Interpretability and Explainable AI
- Creative Applications in Entertainment, Education, and Science

Professional Activities

- Reviewed for: ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, SIGGRAPH Asia, SIGGRAPH, TVCG, ACL, EMNLP, TMLR

Community

- I lead [GGG](https://github.com/GuidedGenerationGroup), a community-driven group dedicated to sharing and discussing papers on Generative AI.
- I host [1:1 Online Coffee Chat](https://forms.gle/x2cTvXhQw7Px2ojF8) to share advice with students from underrepresented backgrounds.

Misc

- [Vines' Log](https://vinesmsuic.github.io/), where I keep my reading notes and various logs.
- I was a member of the HK PolyU Robotics Team during ABU Robocon 2019-2021. [A playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXdlHsDGMmI&list=PLnBb01qou_lcYCLSfbAs-lZ5BZOzWsfSt)
- I used to compete in official gaming tournament [UGC League Team Fortress 2 Highlander](https://www.ugcleague.com/home_tf2h.cfm).
- "Wing Fung" (with the space) is my first name and "Ku" is my last name. "Max" is the commonly used "english name" that is not
  part of my legal name. [This is common in Hong Kong](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/hong-kong-culture/hong-kong-culture-naming#westernising-chinese-names).
