I am a Master of Math in Computer Science student at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). Now I work closely with [Sun Sun](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2X_jP6kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Hongyu Guo](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/view/profile/members/4499) from National Research Council Canada.

Previously, I earned [BSc in Internet and Multimedia Technologies](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/student-and-graduate-stories/) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University with first class honor, being advised by [Prof. Wan-Chi Siu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ouQRncoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Bonnie N.F. Law](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-law-ngai-fong-bonnie/). I was the recipient of [Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholarship](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/gs/ug-research/uris/about-uris/).

My research interests centered in content synthesis and manipulation:

- Image/Video/Molecules + Generation/Editing
- Multimodal (Vision/Language/Biomedical) Understanding

I aim to create AI systems that are highly controllable, reliable, and user-friendly.
