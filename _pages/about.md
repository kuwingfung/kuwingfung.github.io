I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, Faculty of Mathematics, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of generative AI, visual content creation, and model interpretability. I’m particularly interested in making visual generation and editing (images, videos, and beyond) more controllable, interpretable, and usable in creative applications.

At the heart of my work is a simple but ambitious goal:

> To make generative visuals fully controllable across science, communication, and creative applications.

While visuals remain my core focus, I'm increasingly curious about how they can integrate with physical reasoning and scientific understanding. I believe controllability in generative models should go beyond aesthetics, extending to physical coherence and alignment with how we perceive the world.

My work spans:

- Controllable Editing and Generation (I prioritize editing over generation)
- Multimodal Agentic Systems (Visuals + X)
- Interpretability and Explainable AI
- Creative Applications in Entertainment, Education, and Science
